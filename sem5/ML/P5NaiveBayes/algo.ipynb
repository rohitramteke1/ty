    " We then iterate over each row in order to create a new list with only one element for each row, this time named y_.\n",
    " We then split up these lists by using train_test_split which takes three arguments: test size (0.2), random state (0) and what type of splits should be made (in this case, it's set to \"classification\").\n",
    " It returns four values: x-train, x-test, y-train and y-test.\n",
    " The code attempts to take a data set and split it into two parts.\n",
    " The first part will be used for training and the second part will be used for testing.\n",
    " The code then takes the training set and creates a new DataFrame called x_train which contains the input variables of x with their corresponding values in column 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n",
    " It also creates a new DataFrame called x_test which contains the input variables of x with their corresponding values in column 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 but with an additional test variable that is not present in x_train (i.e., test_size=0.2).\n",
    " The code is trying to find the probability of a person having a particular result.\n",
    " It starts by creating an empty dictionary called \"probability\".\n",
    " Then it iterates through each column in the dataframe and creates an empty dictionary for that column, which is then filled with values from the value_counts() function.\n",
    " The next step is to create two dictionaries: one containing all positive results and another containing all negative results.\n",
    " The code iterates through each row in x_train, looking for any rows where y_train == 1 (the desired outcome).\n",
    " For every such row, it looks up the index of that row in x_positive and uses dict(pd.value_counts()) to get the number of times that outcome occurred within those columns.\n",
    " This gives us total occurrences of this outcome across all columns as well as how many times it occurred within each individual column.\n",
    " The code will calculate the probability of a specific outcome for a given input.\n",
    " The code calculates the probability of an outcome where x_train[\"result\"] is equal to 1, and then iterates through each column in x_train.columns and calculates the probabilities of that outcome occurring in each column.\n",
    " The code starts by creating a list of all the columns in x_test.\n",
    " This is done so that it can be used to create an array of probabilities for each column.\n",
    " The code then loops through each row in x_test and creates an array of probabilities for each column, which are stored as probability[column][k] where k is the index of the particular row.\n",
    " The next line initializes baysianprobability with a random number between 0 and 1, which will be used later on to calculate the probability value for any given cell in y_train.\n",
    " The next line calculates the total number of values in y_train using len(x_train).\n",
    " Next, it sets up an empty list called y_pred that will store predictions from this model based on data from x_test.\n",
    " It also sets up a list called column that stores all columns from x-test so they can be iterated over one at a time during training (i.e., iteration over rows).\n",
    " Then comes another loop through every row in x-test and calculates the probability value for each column based on whether or not its corresponding element is positive or negative according to baysianprobability's random number generator\n",
    " The code is a function that takes in two arguments, x_test and baysianprobability.\n",
    " The x_test argument is the dataset of test data to be used for training.\n",
    " The baysianprobability argument is the probability distribution which was created by the code above.\n",
    " The function will iterate through each column of x_test and create an array called y_pred.\n",
    " This array will have one element for each row of x_test.\n",
    " Each row will have a list of all possible values for that column, with the value 0 being omitted from this list.\n",
    " The code starts by creating a list of all the columns in the dataframe.\n",
    " Then, it creates an array called baysianprobability that contains all the probabilities for each column.\n",
    " Next, it loops through each row and calculates individual probability based on Bayes' theorem.\n",
    " The loop then checks if there is a positive or negative probability for this particular row and adds 1 to y_pred if there is a positive probability or 0 otherwise.\n",
    " Finally, it returns y_pred as the predicted values for x_test\n",
    " The code is used to generate a confusion matrix for the given data.\n",
    " The accuracy of the model is calculated by calculating the accuracy score for each row and column of the confusion matrix.\n"
